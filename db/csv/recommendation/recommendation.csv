Kirk Samuelson|Senior Manager|https://www.linkedin.com/in/briangfink|Brian is among the most productive developers I’ve worked with in my career. He picks the more technically difficult tasks and doggedly finds solutions. He’s self-directed, having worked with us both on site and remotely with equal success. Brian has a sharp intellect and quick wit underneath an unassuming presence. He’s modest, personable, and a team player. His work ethic and active development of his native talents make him an exemplary member of our team. He has my unreserved recommendation.
