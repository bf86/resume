Marketing IT at CVS Health used Jenkins for automated builds, and also for deploying some of the older apps, so I have experience setting up Jenkins projects and working with Jenkinsfiles, and also updating Jenkins itself (which is trivial, but it was one of my responsibilities for a time). Based on my experience with it so far, Jenkins is not one of my preferred tools, but I am capable of and willing to work with it (this may have more to do with my team's use cases than with the tool itself). I will say I found it to be less reliable than I expected, and I frequently had to debug discrepancies between behavior observed building locally or on an arbitrary VM in the cluster vs. building with Jenkins. It seemed to me like an overly specialized solution, and like we could have accomplished the same goals with more easily with something more generic like Rundeck or even with simple custom solutions.
