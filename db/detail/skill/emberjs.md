EmberJS was my Marketing IT's primary front-end framework, although I did work a bit with custom frameworks / vanilla JavaScript / jQuery as well. While EmberJS has mostly fallen by the wayside it seems, I'm finding that many of the concepts I learned working with Ember are transferable to React â€” and I much prefer the simplicity and reliability of React to EmberJS, which at times strikes me as over-engineered and unable to perform precisely to spec.
