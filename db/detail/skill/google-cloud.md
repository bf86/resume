After leaving CVS I began experimenting with Google Cloud, and I'm using GC compute engine to host this resume so that I can continue to refine my server administration and Linux skills in the process. This is very similar to how I used Microsoft Azure at CVS, but I find the GCP interface to be much more user friendly. Regardless, I am comfortable using either or adding AWS to my tool belt as well.
