The last major project I completed at CVS involved migrating Athena (see Apps) from on on prem datacenter to Microsoft Azure. This was mostly a "lift and shift" operation, although I did complete some security enhancements, tech debt reduction, and new features along the way. We used an IaaS model and worked with Ubuntu VMs in Azure almost identical to what we had on prem. I also completed a basic Azure AD integration shortly before my departure.
