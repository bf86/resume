I got to work with mongoDB a bit in 2016 while collaborating on a website for one of my bands. I found it easy enough to work with, but I don't think I saw clear advantages over Active Record or even just raw SQL without an ORM. I'm a bit of a Mongo skeptic, I think, partially due to a talk I saw at Node Summit 2018 in which the speaker demonstrated an injection vulnerability that at one point existed in 100% of invocations of Mongo's .where method. Still, it has clearly matured quite a bit since then, and I am interested in learning more about it even if I would hesitate to chose it first for a new project.
