Most of my monitoring experience is with Nagios, but this resume uses a custom monitoring solution I implemented as sort of a fun challenge for myself. I have hourly checks running by cron that send me an email summaries of disk space, API endpoint responses, and threat assessments of unique IPs that visit. I also have a custom script to automatically block malicious IPs at the Google Cloud Firewall. You can see the code for all this on GitHub!
