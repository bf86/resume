I have fairly strong git skills I think and am completely comfortable with using rebase -i, cherry-pick, bisect, reflog, etc. to create a clean commit history that makes it easier for teammates to review my code as a series of logical steps with clear intent. I favor the commit message style recommended by the git documentation, which is a short, capitalized sentence written in the imperative and without a period.
