Ruby was one of the first languages I learned and I enjoy it a lot. I like how many convenience methods it has for all of it's built in classes, and I find it to be easier to work with than NodeJS in many respects. I am a bit rusty with it as I have never gotten to use it professionally, but I'm enjoying re-learning it with some of the custom monitoring scripts I've written for this resume site. I do sometimes wish Ruby had the same function hoisting behavior as JavaScript, because I find it lets me write certain kinds of scripts more eloquently, which function calls at the top almost like a list of tasks and then details on how each of those tasks is performed below, but overall I think the advantages to Ruby outweigh the disadvantages. For speed and asynchronous behavior I would likely choose Node, but for security and maintainability I would probably choose Ruby, and would lean towards Ruby overall.
