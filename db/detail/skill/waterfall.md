As with many large organizations, CVS could be a de facto mix of waterfall, agile, scrum, Kanban, and absolute chaos. I'm mostly kidding about that last clause XD. I had a lot of flexibility to manage my own time and projects, and I will say my approach also did tend to borrow from a few different schools of thought. For large ETL rewrite I completed in 2021, I began with estimates for each stage of the project, which I defined as: Planning and Design, Prototype Build, Prototype Test and Review, Production Build, Production Test and Review, and Release, Monitoring and Warranty. For each phase I allocated roughly 3 to 6 weeks, so longer than a typical sprint but still with some iterative / agile properties. The whole thing took about 7 months to get into production, which beat my Boss' expectation by about a year.
