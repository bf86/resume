One of my largest independent projects at CVS was a full rewrite of the code portion of the Athena Promo API ETL. This was a fascinating challenge for me, and I learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of my approach. I had to complete this under quite a bit of pressure, because the old ETL had stopped performing to spec and was causing outdated prices to appear in a production database, which I was assured by the business could us millions very rapidly if not corrected to 100% accuracy. I wrote an immediate same day hotfix in the form of a secondary ETL that compared the result of the primary to its upstream source and corrected any inaccuracies, and then spent the next several months expanding and improving the backup ETL until it was ready to fully the primary, adding speed and time to recovery enhancements in the process as well.
