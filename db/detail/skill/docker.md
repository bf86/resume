Marketing IT used docker in production for almost all of our apps, and in 2016 I introduced the Docker Desktop (it was called Docker for Mac at the time) local development workflow as well. This resume API is also running in docker containers. I would be curious to try running a production app directly on the host OS without docker, but I think overall I really enjoy the flexibility and ease of deployment I get from Docker.
