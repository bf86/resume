NodeJS is probably the language with which I have the most professional experience, although not necessarily my favorite. It's come a long way since I started using it in terms of callbacks being largely replaced by Promises and finally the async / await syntax — but I still think it is a little bit more difficult than it needs to be in terms of how it handles type, async, an scoping, and I fear it poses significant security challenges that require a lot of vigilance. Regardless, a skilled and careful developer can still of course create reliable and well engineered software in Node — after all it is a poor craftsperson who blames their tools, as they say. Node was one of my primary languages for my entire tenure at CVS.
