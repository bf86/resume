In 2016 I was I was tasked with modifying CVS "Athena Promo API" to be JSON API compliant. For those not familiar, JSON API is an API specification that, if fully implemented, offers many of the same benefits as GraphQL in terms of allowing consumers to request exactly which fields and related resources they want. It also has a very specific response format, which is intended to reduce the amount of "bike-shedding" within the team. It also happens that EmberJS natively consumes JSON API, which is a big part of my Marketing IT chose it (I was a junior developer at the time and did not have much say in that decision). There is a lot to like about JSON API, although I'm not sure I would recommend it in all cases as I think it tends to couple API responses to a relational database model more closely than is necessary, and may at times be a bit more academic than practical. There are some very useful and convenient ways to deliver data that aren't JSON API compliant, and proper internal API documentation can adequately cover the need filled by the JSON API specification in many cases.
