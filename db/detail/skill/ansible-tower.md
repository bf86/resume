I worked with Ansible Tower on and off for my entire tenure at CVS Health. The Marketing IT team used Ansible Tower for infrastructure automation tasks such as ensuring proper file structure, provisioning servers, installing certificates, creating NFS mounts, and placing Nagios configs â€” but we also used it for app deployments, which is a bit non-standard and arguably against the purpose of the tool, since as I understand it one of Tower's main selling points is idempotence.
