This resume is my first Fastify project, and I absolutely love it so far! It has everything I enjoyed about working with Express / Swagger / Open API, and none of the headaches involved in the very opinionated nature of the frameworks approach to validation and documentation. I think I prefer custom solutions for those pieces where possible, and you can see I've implemented a basic swagger type API documentation UI on top of the Fastify resume API.
