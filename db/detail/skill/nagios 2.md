Marketing IT used Nagios for monitoring of disk space, API responses, container status, load average, and more. I advocated for even stronger monitoring including actual API response content rather than just status code, and more granular control over where and how to send alerts. Earlier in my career we had a bit of a tendency to let meaningful alerts get lost in a see of false alarms, or chatty non-production systems, and I did everything I could to advocate for as much granularity as possible so that each teammate could subscribe to exactly which alerts were most relevant to them.
